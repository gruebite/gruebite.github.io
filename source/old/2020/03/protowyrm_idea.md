This is an idea I've had for awhile, but could never figure out how enemies interacted and attacked you until recently. Protowyrm is an arcade style game loosely based off the original Snake, the novel parts being omnidirectional movement and the method for killing enemies. In Protowyrm you control a space wyrm that has outlived galaxies. Your goal: consume. Intelligent life has once again made an appearance on the universe's stage, and once again, the Protowyrm consumes.

I'll be back in a day or so.
