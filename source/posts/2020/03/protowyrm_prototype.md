For the prototype I wanted to test enemy interaction, and while this is not perfect, it gives a good feel:

<video controls>
<source src="/assets/2020/03/protowyrm.webm" type="video/ogg" />
</video>

What I like about Protowyrm is movement controls. Controlling a snake-like dragon in itself is pretty fun. Now add more enemy types, visual feedback, a space backdrop, stars, planets, and it would be pretty cool. I may come back to this in the future.
