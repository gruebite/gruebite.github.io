One thing you have to keep in mind when building a dungeon crawler and generating maps is connectedness. You don't want the player or essential features to be inaccessible from the rest of the map. Some games overcome this by making it possible to dig. I want to take a different approach to avoiding the need for connectedness: negative space.

In Inversive the map is a monochromatic map, where you can walk on either color with the opposing color being the walls. The specific details of the mechanics I haven't decided on yet, but I would like moving between spaces to play a huge role. We'll see! The prototype will have a random monochromatic map and the ability to move between spaces with some effect. Perhaps at that point I'll find some interesting ways to play the existing elements.
