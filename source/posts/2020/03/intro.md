I have been participating in the [2020 7DRL](https://7drl.com/) for over a decade now (in the past I went by the alias "jab"). It's an event I look forward to every year. It's a fantastic testbed for ideas and a good spark for more ideas. So, after successfully submitting [Sow](https://guebite.itch.io/sow) for the [2020 7DRL](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2020), I find myself wanting more.

A few years ago, back in 2011, a few of us in #rgrd did a [1-day Roguelike](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=1DRL_Challenge,_December_2011). It was a lot of fun and I am considering hosting something like this on Itch: a monthly 1DRL.

However, a monthly 1-day Roguelike challenge wouldn't be enough, so I'm creating a challenge for myself. In addition to creating this site, which I will update semi-regularly, I am going to create a prototype in a "day or so," with a hard limit of 7 days for the more involved prototypes. Before I start a prototype I will post the idea here, and a day or so later I will make a second post going over the prototype in detail. During that time you will occasionally streaming it on Twitch. We'll see what comes out of this!
